<h1 align="left">Physical Inventory Application V1üíªüì¶</h1>

###

<p align="left">The application assists with the digital recording process of the physical count of all item in a warehouse or business to verify their actual cuantity and compare it with the accounting records or the application used by the company. <ins><b>The aplication includes a robust authentication and authorization system.</b></ins> There are two types of access: Administrator and User</p>

<p align="left">The application process begins with the Administrator role, who must enable a "Period". To create the period, simply select the month and year in wich the Physical Inventory will be taken. The Administrator must also upload the accounting records the company wishes to count using 3 Excel Files to compare what is currently in the system with what is counted in the inventory. The 3 Excel files that the Administrator must upload to the applications: <ins>Storage Bin</ins> (locations), <ins>Materials</ins> and <ins>Initial Load</ins> (values of company is stock of materialsat the beginning of an accounting period).</p>

<p align="left">The user role will perfom the physical count and record it in the application. The counting proccess begins with the identification of the material and location; this information is obteined through labels containing 2D codes. The usermust write or scanner to read the material and location codes. Then, the user will count and the quantity counted in pieces will be recorded. If the user's record is not included in the Initial Load fileby the Administrator, it is saved as an "Additional" item in the report to be considered in the final report. </p>

<p align="left">Only the Administrator role will be able to view, modify and delete user's records. This view is a report that show the inventory differences between Initial Load file by Admistrator uploaded and the Inventory count by applictation.</p>

<p align="left">As result, the Administrator can download 2 types of reports:<br/>1- Detailed Report for each user record - Excel File<br/>2- Total Report by material and location - Excel File</p>
